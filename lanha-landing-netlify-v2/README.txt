Lan Ha Bay Landing Page (Static)

This is a no-build, drag-and-drop site (works on GitHub Pages and Netlify).

Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- assets/hero.jpg
- assets/logo.svg

Netlify deploy:
- Build command: (none)
- Publish directory: . (root)
- The contact form uses Netlify form capture (data-netlify="true").
  After first deploy, submit the form once so Netlify registers it.

Things you might still need for a real launch:
- Replace placeholder copy with pricing, meeting point, itinerary, and what’s included.
- Add waivers, insurance, and safety wording for each activity.
- Compress hero image for faster loading.
- Add Open Graph metadata for social sharing (optional).
